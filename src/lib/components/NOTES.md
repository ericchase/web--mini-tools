During builds, `*.html` files are processed to replace tags that look like custom elements from Web Components API by replacing them with the contents of `*.html` files from this folder (`src/lib/components/`) that have a filename matching the tag name. You may still use official Custom Elements (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements). Each name of a component or custom element must be unique.
