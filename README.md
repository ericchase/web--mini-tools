## Copyright & License

**TL;DR:**

> This code is truly free and open source, licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. If you make a copy, _I humbly ask_ that you include the text from the `NOTICE` file somewhere in your project. **_You are not required to!_** You are also not required to include the original `LICENSE-APACHE` or `NOTICE` files, and I would prefer just a copy of the `NOTICE` file text or a link to this repository instead. You can use and modify this code however you like, including using a proprietary license for your changes. The only restriction I maintain is under clause 3 of the Apache 2.0 License regarding patents. If you find any potential license violations within any of my projects, please contact me so that I may resolve them.
